DESCRIPTION:

The following is the submission of the graduation project for AMIT's
Embedded Systems course. 

The project is divided into PWM_Generator and PWM_DRAWER_YOUSEF_ELSAYED

PWM_Generator is mainly built for programming a microcontroller to only generate 
a PWM signal. 

PWM_DRAWER_YOUSEF_ELSAYED is built for reading an external PWM signal and determining
its duty cycle and frequency in order to display them onto a connected LCD. 

Attached is a PDF showcasing the project and explaining objectives, and completed phases
of the project.

There is also a video attached to showcase these phase completions.
